    <h2>What is Stratagus?</h2>
    <p>
    Stratagus is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
    It includes support for playing over Internet/LAN, or playing vs.
    computer opponents. The engine is configurable and can be used to
    create games with a wide-range of features specific to your needs.
    <p>
    Stratagus started as a clone of the realtime fantasy strategy game
    Warcraft II from Blizzard Entertainment, although it is used now as a
    game engine to build other games, sci-fi or fantasy ones.
