<p/><li>2.4.1 Released<p/></li>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Reliability: Fall back to software and windowed rendering before
	    giving up on startup. This fixes the trouble some people have when
	    they enable OpenGL or an unsupported fullscreen resolution and now the
	    game won't start. Otherwise, they have to know where the
	    preferences.lua file is stored and either delete or edit it.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Commandline: -Z now takes a WIDTHxHEIGHT argument, too, to define the
	    base resolution to scale up from.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugfix: Warping mouse coordinates in zoomed mode was not scaled correctly.

	  <li>
	    Installation: Include tinyfiledialogs and make extraction of game
	    data more consistent for games that want it by offering the
	    functionality on first launch based on header defines in the game
	    launchers.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugfix: Regenerating forest tiles should no longer set the wrong tile index
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Graphics: Allow each game to ship its own shaders by searching in the game data path

    <li>Added Now enemy buildings will look under the fog with the last seen frame (or will not show if you haven't seen them yet) FIXME: if seen building under fog is ruined it will disappear</li>
    <li>Fixed bug: in UnitVisible() for fog of war</li>
    <li>Added Unit.rs which is filled by MakeUnit() with random number between 1 and 100, used for fancy buildings. `fancy buildings'! every building is drawn randomly normal or flipped horizontally, so the your city will have some buildings pointed to right and some to left! i.e. will not look uniform.</li>
    <li>Rewritten DrawUnits</li>
    <li>Added TileTypeTables -- used to lookup what tile is what? i.e. which tiles are woods, water,... required for the fog</li>
    <li>Added cheats -- for debug really :)</li>
    <li>Fixed bug: Fixes seen wood bug.</li>

    <li>New tool written in C: wartool, includes all xxx2png in one file.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Reworked the rectangle selection to match the one of w*rcr*ft 2: Select a group of player's "mobile" units. if none, select a construction from that player. if still none, select a (random) neutral unit (critter, mine...) if still none, select a (random) enemy unit.</li>
    <li>The dead body animation is now displayed.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in DestroyUnit(): Units in transporters weren't destroyed (although they were still "removed" from the map. There is still a problem though, as the dead bodies of the units in the transporters are displayed. Sorry I didn't look at this yet.</li>
    <li>Modified a couple of things in DestroyAllInside(), to speed up things in special cases (transporters, construction...)</li>
    <li>ChangeUnitOwner() is now recursive. This is not important for w*rcr*ft but it will be interesting for st*rcr*ft.</li>
    <li>Various code cleanups, code optimizations, minor changes, and things I forgot...</li>
    <li>AiFindFreeWorkers now finds free workers.</li>
    <li>In unit_find.c I added 2 functions FindUnitsByType() and FindPlayerUnitsByType(). These are general functions but used by the AI code and building construction/destruction (halls/lumber mill/...)</li>
    <li>I added ActionUnitConstructed test to UnitUnusable(): A building under construction can be considered unusable :). There is an exception though when you select a building under construction with the mouse. For example, the peons harvesting wood were bringing it back to the lumber mill under construction...</li>
    <li>When a keep/stronghold/castle/fortress is constructed, gold/wood/oil harvested is adjusted if necessary.</li>
    <li>Now when a castle/keep/stronghold/../lumber mill/refinery is destroyed, the gold/wood/oil harvested is correctly adjusted.</li>
    <li>It's now possible to cancel the construction of a building.</li>
    <li>New memory management. The main memory array isn't used directly anymore (except for debug message and network code), and the units are accessed by arrays of pointers (the solution isn't currently memory optimized, but this can be modified quite easily). There are currently 3 kind of "lists": Used unit slots, free unit slots, and a list of units used by each player. This implies a bunch of (more or less) small changes through the code...</li>
    <li>Gold mined, wood harvested and oil hauled is added to the player's resources as soon as the peon/peasant reach the hall/mill/... Note that this is the standard behaviour of w*rcr*ft 2. This part generates a bunch of warnings from the AI saying that it can't build a farm. This is just this: a warning. As soon as it is possible (the peon gets out of the hall), the farm is builded.</li>
    </ul>
