<h1>FAQ for Stratagus</h1>
<hr>

    <b>Q: How do I create a game using the engine?</b><br>
    A: We strongly recommend that you help an existing game instead
    of creating yet another one. There are way to many wannabe games
    and none finished.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Stratagus work with ALSA?</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with ALSA support.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the Stratagus network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: Stratagus uses UDP with port 6660 by default, you may start stratagus
    with '-Pxxxx' flag to use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does stratagus support internet/metaserver play?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature.<p>

    <b>Q: Stratagus runs really slow in large resolutions, what can I do?</b><br>
    A: Versions of Stratagus from 2.1 update the screen every frame.
    Use OpenGL or play with a smaller screen resolution.<p>

    <b>Q: Can I use Stratagus to play Age of Empires, StarCraft, or any
    other commercial game?</b><br>
    A: No.<p>

    <b>Q: My question isn't answered here.</b><br>
