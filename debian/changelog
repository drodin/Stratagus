stratagus (2.4.2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Reliability: Fall back to software and windowed rendering before
    giving up on startup. This fixes the trouble some people have when
    they enable OpenGL or an unsupported fullscreen resolution and now the
    game won't start. Otherwise, they have to know where the
    preferences.lua file is stored and either delete or edit it.
  * Commandline: -Z now takes a WIDTHxHEIGHT argument, too, to define the
    base resolution to scale up from.
  * Bugfix: Warping mouse coordinates in zoomed mode was not scaled correctly.
  * Metaserver: Implement simple UDP hole punching to allow connections through some NATs
  * Metaserver: Add CREATEGAME command
  * Metaserver: Allow access for non-registered users
  * Bugfix: Remove checksumming of lua files for now due to issues
  * Installation: Include tinyfiledialogs and make extraction of game
    data more consistent for games that want it by offering the
    functionality on first launch based on header defines in the game
    launchers.
  * Bugfix: Regenerating forest tiles should no longer set the wrong tile index
  * Graphics: Allow each game to ship its own shaders by searching in the game data path
  * Keybindings: Use Alt+/ and Alt+\ do change shaders globally

  * Added support for playing music in menu (from Pali Rohar)
  * Fixed Windows NSIS Installer (use relative jumps, 
    do not allow start instaler twice, register games, ...) (from Pali Rohar)

stratagus (2.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Let's see if we can calm Guilherme de S. Pastore. :-) (thanks for the
    severe revision and sending patches).
    - debian/control:
      - Removed bogus ${misc:Depends} dependency (closes: #291102).
      - Changed build dependency to libpng12-dev (closes: #303702).
    - README now does not point to unshipped doc/install.html file (closes:
    #298146).
    - debian/copyright: Copyright and license are now clearly differentiated
    (closes: #291098).
    - Installed doc-base section for stratagus and stratagus-gl (closes:
    #291103).

stratagus (2.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/sdl.c: Imported from upstream CVS a fix for bug #268711 (stratagus unpauses when
    minimized). Closes: #268711.
  * debian/control: Applied patch from Guilherme de S. Pastore. In fact,
    decided later to rewrite parts of Description fields to fit more closely
    what stratagus is today. Closes: #268486.
  * debian/stratagus.6: Fixed grammar mistakes, by Guilherme de S. Pastore.
    Closes: #268488.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Oct 2004 11:34:52 +0200

stratagus (2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/movie/movie.c: Added code to disable movies. Then disabled movies on
    Alpha, due to segfaults in vp31 code. In next releases theora will be
    used, which could be safe, but now it is avoiding to have updated
    stratagus into sarge (closes: #261147).
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Removed old stuff inherited from the
    freecraft package. Stratagus, unlike FreeCraft, no longer use SVGAlib.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Aug 2004 09:12:11 +0200

stratagus (2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really replaced the right upstream authors that Gilherme suggested in
    debian/copyright. Ooops...
  * debian/control: followed the guidelines for short description in the
    Developers's Manual and decapitalized them.
  * Argh. In 2.1-2 I added a superfluous /data to the default gamedir in
    src/include/stratagus.h. Sorry. Thanks, Encolpe DEGOUTE (closes: #263183).

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Thu,  5 Aug 2004 19:34:22 +0200

stratagus (2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed date and version in stratagus.6 manpage.
  * debian/control: I keep forgetting that versioned Depends on virtual
    packages DOES NOT WORK. Thanks to Yann Dirson for pointing this on bug
    #260562. So removed the Provides: stratagus on stratagus-gl section. This
    will be work for dataset, depending either on stratagus or stratagus-gl.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jul 2004 14:32:17 +0200

stratagus (2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Big thanks to Guilherme de S. Pastore, who was *very* interested in
    stratagus being packaged and did preliminar packages. He also provided a
    lot of patches for current packages. You rock!
  * Mmmm...it seems that I did not really fixed #259305 in 2.1-2, but another
    different thing. Now the authors are really who they are.
  * Fixed the manpage, it was a bit obsolete, and made references to Aleona
    and fcmp. Also updated the authors' names (closes: #259309).
  * debian/control:
    - Removed autoconf references and removed configure removals. Sorry for
      the annoyance.
    - stratagus-gl provides stratagus.
  * debian/rules: Removed Linux-specific check (closes: #259311).

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jul 2004 18:42:37 +0200

stratagus (2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Added autoconf (closes: #258450).
    - Stratagus is a realtime strategy game and not a realtime fantasy game.
      Changed Description (Thanks, FranÃ§ois Beerten).
    - Cutted down too long lines in Description.
  * It seems that stratagus 2.0-1 changelog was not processed. Closes:
    #204661, #245692).
  * debian/rules: By error switched lines and the epoch section of the fake
    freecraft package was run before dh_gencontrol. Anyway, building of fake
    freecraft packages is disabled by now, so this is not really important.
  * Added some checks to the main Makefiles and added real use of OUTFILE
    variable. This permitted to split package in stratagus and stratagus-gl
    packages (with OpenGL disabled and enabled, respectively). This closes:
    #258167.
  * Added quotes in debian/*.menu for avoiding lintian warnings.
  * Removed README.Debian, remnant from the FreeCraft times.
  * Finally remembered to add a default dataset in include/stratagus.h
    (/usr/share/games/stratagus/default) for running 'stratagus' alone.

stratagus (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * freecraft legacy packages are at this moment not built. As Guillerme said,
    the upgrade path is not clear.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jul 2004 15:27:21 +0200

stratagus (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many things had happened to give a complete explanation. Summarizing,
    FreeCraft project was obligued to cease by Blizzard pressure. This package
    is the official fork of the FreeCraft Project, thus continuing the superb
    work of the many developers adhered to this project. Good bye, FreeCraft,
    and long and peaceful life, Stratagus!
  * I decided to maintain all the previous structure and create fake packages
    to make the transition as smooth as possible.
  * New upstream release (closes: #204661).
  * Stratagus is packaged, so this closes the ITP (closes: #245692).
  * debian/changelog: Changed to UTF-8.
  * debian/copyright: Changed to UTF-8.
  * debian/control:
    - Added missing ${misc:Depends}.
    - Changed to UTF-8.
    - Added dependencies on libvorbis-dev and liblualib50-dev, and removed
      bash by fixing the bashism in Makefile.
    - The Description field now shows reality, not dreams. :-) (addresses
      part of #197286).
  * debian/rules: Cleaned all the freecraft references and rewritten some
    parts to adapt to the new build system.
  * debian/menu: Changed things to Stratagus.
  * Removed debian/TODO.
  * Updated stratagus manpage.

freecraft (1:1.18-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (closes: #182909). This really fixes the fcmp
    breakage as well (closes: #185657).
  * This is a much more advanced version, with tons of bugs fixed (literally).
  * Options are now saved (closes: #177305).
  * Save & Load is working now for single player (closes: #168800).
  * This bug is unreproducible and it's probably fixed in this version,
    whatever it were (closes: #167119).
  * arts support was born in the middletime (not built in yet). More to come.
    We have really had arts support before with libsdl1.2-arts...
  * debian/patches: Dropped by now 02_sound_big_endian (merged upstream) and
    04_64bit_archs_fix (makes freecraft campaigns segfault). The rest of the
    patches went resynced. This brings freecraft campaign game again into life
    (closes: #173645, #185069).
  * debian/control: Bumped debhelper dependency to >> 4.0.0. Updated
    dependencies to reflect the gcc-3.2 transition. Depends on fcmp
    >=1.18.20030311. Dropped the Build-Conflicts because of 03_setup_fixes
    patch. Now is more safe to build freecraft.
  * debian/rules: Moved DH_COMPAT to debian/compat as joeyh recommends.
    Rewrote several parts, because it was going messy. Fully support for debug
    builds, with profiling included.
  * This release has good sound. Please reopen if not fixed (closes: #163135).
  * The font used for the buttons is now different, thus not making that
    strange effect (closes: #137279).
  * The tools for importing WCII data into freecraft are *not* working yet.
    Added to README.Debian. Read it for details.

freecraft (1:1.17.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more options and completed the yet incomplete freecraft.6 manpage.
  * debian/patches/04_64bit_archs_fix: Added nice patch from Steve Langasek
    (the Debian postmodern programmer :-) for building really-working
    freecraft binaries for 64-bit architectures (more to come). Closes:
    #170603.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.8.
  * debian/rules: s/debug/noopt/ in order to comply with Policy 3.5.8. Also
    removed ChangeLog.html from doc/ directory because we already ship it as
    changelog.gz.
  * debian/control: Changed Standards-Version, removed last full-stop from
    Description: line in order to kill lintian warning.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Dec 2002 01:53:24 +0100

freecraft (1:1.17.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/02_sound_big_endian: Fix for the sound on big-endian
    architectures (ppc and the rest). Thanks, Ethan Benson, for remembering
    it :-) (closes: #145777).
  * debian/control: Bumped again libpng dependencies to libpng3.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Aug 2002 01:03:49 +0200

freecraft (1:1.17.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Removed g++ from the ia64 build environment.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Jul 2002 23:36:22 +0200

freecraft (1:1.17.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added g++-3.0 for ia64 hoping that finally that fix the
    autobuilds. Also bumped dependencies for fcmp (I recalled this in the very
    moment I uploaded new version of freecraft). This will close #152057, but
    this is work for fcmp changelog.
  * Thanks to linda, added doc/ChangeLog.html as upstream changelog, and
    removed doc/install.html from package.
  * Finally added support for svgalib-dummyg1, so closes: #143260.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Jul 2002 10:22:39 +0200

freecraft (1:1.17.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * CVS sync as of 05 Jul 2002. This is just version 1.17.2 final.
  * Lutz Summer, Jimmy Salmon, and the rest of the FreeCraft team keep killing
    bugs at a extraordinary rate. The summary of the changes is:
    - Fixed red/blue color for water in minimap (closes: #148697).
    - Revamped Load & Save dialogs and routines. This has rendered #148285
      unreproducible, so closes: #148285.
    - Activated again the network menus (but not from command line). 1.17.2
      games are incompatible with 1.17 network games.
    - Fixed many memory leaks and crashes.
    - Added global options, for resolution, fog mode, full-screen, etc.
    - Added a simple map editor (primary intended for developers) in
      FreeCraft. Not to replace crafted, but to give more flexibility to the
      developers (crafted is far more user-friendly).
    - Added a 'capture building' option with peons.
    - Added Alt-R, Ctrl-R hotkeys to restart scenario.
  * debian/control: Added Suggests: crafted.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 15:25:05 +0200

freecraft (1:1.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uups. I forgot to remove my ccache tests from the setup file. Sorry,
    autobuilders. :-( (closes: #148570).
  * CVS sync as of 05 Jun 2002. This is version 1.17.1pre1.
    It kills several bugs (with the wrapper, and with multiplayer issues).
    Also implements screenshots (even with a hotkey!).
  * The multiplayer API is dropped at the moment. Changed freecraft.6 and
    dropped patch #02_help_fixes.
  * Now there is a hotkey to save the current game, Alt+Ctrl+S. BTW, I'm
    unable to reproduce now #148285. Alfie?
  * debian/control: Downgrade the libpng requirements to libpng2 (>=1.0.12).
  * debian/answers.*: Upstream keeps changing the read semantic in setup, so
    changed again to cope with the new (old) format. :-)
  * Sorry, ia64 folks, for not really changing the compiler to gcc-3.0 in
    1.17-1. Now I'm sure I've made the changes. Hope that works. This closes:
    #143246.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Jun 2002 10:55:57 +0200

freecraft (1:1.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is FreeCraft 1.17 (final release)! (closes:
    #148432).
  * Changes in this release are many (as always, see doc/Changelog.html for
    the gory details):
    - Water effect intro screen (cool!).
    - Multiple views in the screen (cooler!).
    - Fixed a lot of bugs (coolest!).
    - Diplomacy over network, enhanced usability.
    - Network menus finally work (closes: #139150).
    - Added more shortcuts.
  * Added an epoch due to the versions scheme in previous releases.
  * Cleaned a bit the debian/ dir.
  * debian/control:
    - Adjusted dependencies. freecraft needs at least fcmp version
      1.17.20020526.
    - Build-Conflicts with libmad0-dev and libflac-dev. I don't want by any
      means to break my delicate answering machine for the setup.
    - Changed the compiler to gcc-3.0 in ia64. gcc-2.96 is making a bad job
      building freecraft (in fact, trying to).
  * debian/answers.*: Upstream changed again the parsing procedure in
    setup...this is becoming funny :-). Fixed.
  * Enhanced the freecraft.6 manpage.
  * debian/patches: Updated a little in order to fix offsets.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Thu, 30 May 2002 11:31:23 +0200

freecraft (1.17pre1build18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS sync as of 09 May 2002. Changes:
    - Support for complete campaign/level in a zip file.
    - Scenario requester now remembers path during one game.
    - Other fixes.
  * Ryan Murray is the fastest autobuilder in the world. The package was in
    incoming for minutes and he filed a bug against freecraft autobuilding...
    :-) Now 01_cvs_pull patch exists (closes: #146355). Thanks, guy!

freecraft (1.17pre1build18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is build18.
  * CVS sync as of 30 Apr 2002. The relevant changes (see
    /usr/share/doc/freecraft/doc/Changelog.html for details) are:
    - More fixes for the new OGG/MP3/WAV/FLAC support.
    - The campaign menu is now configurable (closes: #143301).
    - Added lots of control options (volume, keyboard, etc.).
    - Fixed a bunch of other bugs.
  * Upstream changed setup behaviour, so changed answers.* file format.
  * This release, like previous ones, adds more stuff to freecraft.6 manpage.
  * debian/patches: Fixed offsets in several of them.
  * debian/control: Corrected description (thanks, Meinolf Sander). Closes:
    #143185.

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Thu,  9 May 2002 08:44:54 +0200

freecraft (1.17pre1build17-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. This is build17.
  * CVS sync as of 8 Apr 2002 (closes: #139835). The relevant changes (for the
    gory details see /usr/share/doc/freecraft/doc/Changelog.html) are:
    - This release fixes several crashes observed by the most extensive tester
      that freecraft in Debian has: Daniel Burrows (that I've noticed, maybe
      there are others :-) .
    - CD player support for libcda, SDL and madmp3.
    - Flac, OGG and MP3 audio format added (not compiled in because are
      unstable yet).
    - Randomize start positions in network play, by Daniel Burrows (closes:
      #137737).
    - Added a lot of new displayings.
    - Added more unit selection tools.
    - Units now has an autogenerated name :-).
    - Added big map mode (Alt-B, Ctrl-B).
    - A lot of cosmetic issues (scrolling credits, pictures between
      missions, stereo sound for missiles and units...)
    - Fixed a bunch of other bugs.
  * debian/control:
    - Dropped definitely the bogus dependency on libsdl1.2debian-all, as
      Daniel Burrows has nicely explained to me with patience (many thanks to
      Daniel). Also modified the description accordingly. This closes: #137275.
    - Depends: on new release of fcmp, because the old causes freecraft to
      segfault sometimes (almost always for me).
    - **Architectures field changed back to 'any'**. I'd like comments on this
      issue, please. Is freecraft working on your sparc/alpha/mips/m68k/etc.
      well? I'll keep looking at the autobuilders logs, but user experience is
      the most reliable test. Closes: #140537.
  * Compiled in with SDL_CD support. The rest of the new features (Flac, OGG,
    MP3...) will have to wait.
  * Commented out the line #include "rdtsc.h" in src/map/map_{draw,fog}.c and
    src/ai/new_ai.c that were preventing freecraft from being compiled on all
    the Debian architectures. This should deal with several open bugs. We'll
    see...(closes: #54455, #110165).
  * Compiled with -fsigned-char because the code is making a lot of
    assumptions about the signedness of char data type. This deals with the
    remaining part of #137338 and closes #140882, so closes: #137338, #140882.
    Still remain probably many errors about signedness of other data types.
    Please report them and send patches if you can.
  * Also included the tools in /usr/lib/games/freecraft for converting the
    original WarCraft II artwork to data format understood by freecraft, but
    I'm not really supporting them yet (you're warned).
  * debian/rules: Added support for debian/patches.
  * Moved most of my modifications to debian/patches, as well as the CVS patch.
  * Corrected freecraft.6 manpage, and added yet more stuff to it (closes:
    #141517). At last we'll have a complete manpage, after all. :-)

freecraft (1.17pre1build16-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The 'Yes, I need more sleep, and also to test my releases' release.
  * debian/control: Dropped for now dependency on freecraft-data because
    we needed a versioned Depends against fcmp (and I found by any chance
    that versioned dependency on virtual packages doesn't work).
    Closes: #138392.
  * Added some cruft to freecraft.6 manpage.

freecraft (1.17pre1build16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS synced as of 3-10-2002.
  * Lots of improvements:
    - AI is now much better and clever, uses transports, and has several
      things fixed.
    - There is basic support for campaigns (also the last release of fcmp
      had support in it, but I didn't think about it and things broke.)
      Now this closes: #138361.
    - CD player support with SDL.
    - Added triggers support.
    - And lots of other things, specially this release deals with the
      segfault reported by Daniel Burrows, so closes: #137710.
    - If you're interested, see the last 20 lines in doc/ChangeLog.html.
  * Closing bugs fixed with the previous release (closes: #137875).
  * Some signedness problems are addressed, but there are so many of
    them in the code that I'll get some time fixing (see #137338).
  * debian/control: Updated description, and added a tigher dependency
    on fcmp (>=200203xx).
  * Updated a lot the freecraft.6 manpage (still needs some polishing :-).

 -- David MartÃ­nez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Mar 2002 01:20:24 +0100

freecraft (1.17pre1build16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Something weird happened with my upload to the new incoming
    system, because it REJECTED my final upload on March 6th but
    accepted a broken upload on March 1rd. :-? Some bugs were not
    fixed yet, and ... eeerkk. Also aj and others are messing me
    with advices and ... let's release this version at last.
  * Get in sync with *my* version of freecraft. The following are
    the lines that the 1.17pre1build16-1 release missed:
    * Dear ftpmasters, this package is *really* ale-clone (with
      another name).
    * debian/control:
      - Changed Architectures field. Now I'm sure that, at this moment,
        freecraft won't compile on other architectures apart from i386
        and alpha. This has to do with bug #54455 (ale-clone: not for
        m68k?).
    * I accept my NMU :-), so closes: #101414.
    * Added a menu entry (closes: #57676).
  * Now, it happens that Daniel Burrows has reviewed thoroughly freecraft
    and filed several bugs (sadly most of them fixed in my real release).
    Thank you, guy. :-)
  * From the sync: Defined FREECRAFT_LIB_PATH as /usr/share/games/freecraft/default
    in order to use the alternatives set up in fcmp.
  * From the sync: Freecraft is again usable from any place you want (this and
    the above closes: #137276).
  * From the sync: Freecraft has a menu entry (closes: #57676, #137278).
  * debian/control:
    - Among other things, dropped doc generation (aj says that it's stupid).
    - Changed Build-Depends to make svgalibg1-dev i386 only (address part
      from #137338).
  * Changed build options for non-i386 architectures, because svgalib only
    exists on i386 (address part from #137338).
  * Fixed width to less than 80 columns in README.Debian (closes: #137566).
  * Freecraft built with new libSDL.

freecraft (1.17pre1build16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yes, I know that this package is not ale-clone anymore, but I
    want to close (or maybe have noted) the bugs in ale-clone. The
    bugs that this release close are relative to ale-clone, not
    freecraft (an almost new package). But this release closes
    several RC bugs, so I'm not really worried about closing bugs from
    here.
  * New upstream release and name change (closes: #94202).
  * New maintainer (closes: #119258).
  * Built with HAVE_EXPANSION, for preparing it for an eventual use
    with non-free data (e.g. WarCraft II(tm) CD).
  * debian/ files rewritten from scratch.
  * debian/control:
    - Added doc++ dependency for building the documentation.
    - Upstream has changed the name of the package, so I've added
      corresponding Conflicts/Provides.
    - It seems that this release will be compatible with FCMP (FreeCraft Media
      Project) out of the box. Because we need some game data, and we _want_
      freecraft in main, I changed definitively the section and added Depends
      on freecraft-data. Welcome to main, freecraft!
    - Added Build-Conflicts on the various flavors of libsdl1.2debian and
      a Build-Depends on libsdl1.2debian-all. This also closes: #104785,
      #121684, #135325.
    - Corrected typos in the description (closes: #124409).
  * Fixed a lot of typos in the documentation.
  * make depend is failing, so I've added $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) into Common.mk in
    order to make gcc -E happy.
  * I'm very anxious to see if buildd's can cope with this package.
    Upstream claims that it'll compile. Time will say...
  * Configured /usr/share/games/freecraft/data as the data directory.
  * FreeCraft can now use X Windows System with 8/15/16/24/32bit X Server, so
    this means that now closes: #127870.
  * I accept my NMU :-), so closes: #121684.
